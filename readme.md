# Tyris Flare

## Overview

Meet Tyris Flare, a red-haired amazon who can kick ass and hurl fire!

Sound familiar? That's because I decided to have a nostalgia trip and recreate a character from ye olde Golden Axe computer games that were released on the Sega Mega Drive (or Genesis in America) and arcade machines in the 90s. You may also have seen her recently in Golden Axe: Beast Master, though my interpretation of the character is from the older games.

How does she end up in Baldur's Gate II? You'll have to play to find out!

Once in your party, Tyris will banter with all BioWare NPCs and can be romanced by any human/elf/half-elf male PC. Enjoy!
